        <h1 id="notes-from-the-hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-003-exam">Notes from the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003) Exam</h1>
<p>I recently cleared the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003) exam. Here are a few takeaways from my experience with the exam, my experience with Terraform as a whole, and (optionally) a couple of lab exercises.</p>

<h1 id="general-thoughts">General Thoughts</h1>
<p>All in all, I had a good experience taking the exam. As with most technical certifications, I don't feel that it covers <em>everything</em> that one needs to know to be a perfectly fluent SRE or developer who writes beautiful, bullet-proof, production-grade code. But, I do think it aligns well overall with 'the real world' so to speak, and should serve as a solid foundation for anyone newer to IaC, or experienced individuals looking to validate their knowledge of Terraform.</p>
<p>If you do have experience with Terraform, your required prep time should be reduced significantly. I found many questions throughout the exam to be intuitive - particularly ones that I presume fell into the <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003/associate-study-003#navigate-the-core-workflow">navigating the terraform workflow</a>, section, and likely a few of the other basic sections. These types of questions should be easy to reason through for experienced Terraformers and align to most Terraform tasks performed on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I relied primarily on previous experience and reviewing some nuances of HashiCorp Language (HCL) to help with some of the more tedious concepts, for instance, questions that require reading through code blocks like <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003/associate-questions#examples">this</a>. Not to mention, I found several questions that required reading code blocks to be a bit more complex than this particular code block. For the most part though, if you've written enough HCL, even these should be straightforward, or you should at least be able to 'eyeball' the correct answer via the syntax. My stance on this is that it doesn't hurt to review, as some of the answer choices will look pretty similar.</p>
<p>The biggest recommendation I would share, particularly to newer Terraformers and coders, pertains to both preparing for the exam, and generally improving your coding skills. <strong>Practice, practice, practice.</strong> <em>Most</em> of your code, whether it's HashiCorp Language or not, is not going to work <em>perfectly</em> (or sometimes even at all) the first time that you write it. Understanding error messages, or why your code didn't result in the exact outcome that you anticipated will go a long way both in terms understanding key Terraform concepts that will help you reason through the exam, and in terms of becoming a better coder.</p>
<h1 id="value-of-terraform">Value of Terraform</h1>
<p>My last comment will speak to the value of Terraform. I think this concept <em>could</em> get lost in the shuffle of preparing for the exam (although <em>shouldn't</em>), but let me speak to one of my favorite aspects of Terraform through a real-world example.</p>
<p>You've all probably heard the buzzwords around IaC. Strict configurations (same deployment each time). Faster deployments. Faster time to market. Efficiency. Reduced manual tasks. and so on. What does it all <em>really</em> mean and where is the real value to a developer? Is it possible to go through a 3-5 minute exercise that will illustrate this? Let's see.</p>
<p>Strictly (buzz word intended) in terms of provisioning tools (not branching out into the realm of configuration management tools like Ansible), Terraform has arguably become the gold standard across enterprises, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>I've seen many SREs who handle a lot of cloud infrastructure provisioning through Python and other custom-written applications, and they did so exceedingly well. Their programs met all of the needs of their given enterprises, but don't have as much reuse value as something like Terraform.</p>
<p>One of the hardest tasks in software engineering is to pick up someone else's code and start using it, much less maintaining and patching it as if it were your own. HashiCorp language is not a complete exception to this phenomenon, but it will significantly reduce the time to transfer ownership of a codebase (say a developer leaves a company) from one developer or team to another because of this &quot;standardization.&quot;</p>
<p>A large part of this &quot;standardization&quot; stems from the support of Terraform providers, who are affording deployers of their software a standard way of interacting with their APIs - via Terraform.</p>
<p>Perhaps the aforementioned SRE finds HCL a bit restrictive, or overly prescriptive in terms of functionality. Maybe they aren't used to writing HCL, or otherwise prefers Python because it aligns to their current skill set. After all, debugging in Terraform requires knowledge of Terraform itself.</p>
<p>I empathize with this SRE because they are likely automating many of their other daily tasks (or tasks across their enterprise) in Python or other similar programming languages. Why not provision infrastructure using the same skills?</p>
<p>Well, we've talked about the transfer of ownership of a codebase, but that's probably not the biggest thing on the SRE's mind. However, I would urge the SRE to consider everything that Terraform would take off of <em>their</em> plate as well.</p>
<p>The effort to learn HCL will pay big dividends faster than you think. It's easy enough to pick a language out of a hat and find an SDK that enables you to quickly start writing code to create, destroy and update your cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>But, you could be missing out on state management capabilities (which are foundational to Terraform), built-in capabilities that Terraform uses to manage dependencies between cloud resources, and plenty of other valuable features that would take a larger programming effort to implement in other languages besides HCL.</p>
<p>What if I used Python to create 6 VPCs, each with 18-22 VMs that were created from one of 8 different instance templates and are part of one of 5 different scaling groups? Then, a new requirement arises where some infrastructure configurations need to be updated. Think of all of the resources that depend on each other in this type of architecture, and the programming effort required to properly manage this environment entirely through code.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a very simple example of this phenomenon through a <a href="https://github.com/atugman/IBM-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Terraform-Lab/lab.html">quick, simple lab</a>.</p>
